# Normal node_modules folder

Your `npm install`ed packages will go here, as usual.  I'm making this abundantly clear, because (if you haven't noticed) there is a **second** `node_modules` dir inside the `code` dir.

You should .gitignore this directory.  I've kept it here so you can visualize the setup.

The `code/node_modules` directory does not get `.gitignore`d, and all of its contents get checked into the repo.
